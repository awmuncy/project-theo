# How I started this project

I started this project with a few technologies I've been using for a while.

## React

I've used React since 2016, and it is one of my favoite frameworks. I've dipped my toes into Vue and Angular in production applications, but it was always within an existing application. I've build many React based applications from scratch. 

I won't pretend to be an impartial judge of React vs other frameworks, but I'll say that I've found it to be a great framework to build applications with. Familiarity with React is a huge plus, and I've found it to be a great way to learn new technologies.

## TypeScript

TypeScript saves me so much annoyance when my applications get larger than even the tiniest pet projects. The code is so much more maintainable, and is also just makes it easier to understand what the heck is going on. 

## Next.js

I've been using Next.js for maybe 3 years. I've built applications with create-react-app, but the added features of Next.js have been a huge plus. 



## Postgres

(Just kidding, using SQLite for now)

SQL databases just make sense to me. Whether it's SQLite, Postgres, MySQL, or something else, I've always found it to be a great way to store data. I considered MongoDB, which I've used a lot, but I've found it's harder to reason about in anything but the simplest of cases.

## SQLite

Eay way to bootstrap a database for a project. Will switch to postgres soon. Luckily, our next tech decision makes switching betweeen these options easy.

## Prisma

ORMs are a great way to make it easier to work with databases.

## Clerk

We got users. We'll need authentication. I've used Clerk for a while, and it's been a great experience.

## CSS (Not just Tailwind)

I love CSS so much, it was my first love in web development. I enjoyed building proper semantics with HTML (accessibility, semantic markup, etc), and functionalities with JavaScript, but building out the _look_ of the application with CSS (and SCSS) was always just so much fun. Frameworks like Tailwind are great for fast developement, but I enjoy the syntax and granularity of CSS. I do think I'll use ShadCN to many components, but I'm not sure yet.
